A game inspired by Robotron 2084. Move the dude by using the arrow keys, aim with the mouse and use the mouse button to fire. 

Every level can be completed! You will need to come up with a different strategy for each one.

This game is a Java applet, which used to run in a web page. Nowadays browsers won't run applets unless you jump through some very high hoops, so the easiest way to play it is to use `appletviewer` which comes with the Java Development Kit.

## To build
You will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

    ./build.sh

## To run
  
    appletviewer ./production/bozotron.html
